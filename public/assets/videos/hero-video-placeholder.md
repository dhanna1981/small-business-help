## Instructions for Implementation

1. Download one of the recommended videos from Pexels (royalty-free)
2. Place the video file in this directory as `hero-background.mp4`
3. Update the VideoHero component to use the local video file
4. Ensure video is optimized for web (compressed, reasonable file size)

## Current Implementation
The VideoHero component uses a Pexels video URL as a fallback until a local video is provided.
